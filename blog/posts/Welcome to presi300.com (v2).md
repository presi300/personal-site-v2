# A ~~big~~ MASSIVE update!

## Yeah, I rewrote the site from the ground up...

## Look mah, there is a blog now!

If this is the 1st time here, welcome, I'm presi300 a (sort of) JavaScript developer.

This is v2 of my personal site... I wrote v1 in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and I don't think I need to say anything more.

Yeah, it became unmaintainable real quick + React is way cooler anyways.

### What's this site all about?

~~Flexing what I can do with react~~ This site is attempting to emulate a sorta MacOS-ish desktop experience on desktop and an android-inspired experience on mobile. V1 is very similar in concept, just really bad in execution, due to, again, my unfortunate decision to write it in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Some notable improvements of V2 are:

- Edge tiling of windows (Take that, MacOS)

There are a lot of other window management improvements, but ain't nobody got time to read about them.

- Smooth(er) animations
- Hugely improved mobile layout

- Markdown support... For the blog.

> Blockquotes!

```javascript
// Yeah, it's a code block...

var foo = "bar";

function baz(s) {
  return foo + ":" + s;
}
```

- Properly working dark mode!

_Now with a funky mode switch_

- A blog! (_So fancy_)

## And a lot more... to come, yeah, this stuff takes time

## _cough_ WIP _cough_
